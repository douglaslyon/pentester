# Pentester

This is a pentration testing system using rfmicro and a custom nrf24l01 shield

## Library Info  

Code can fail when there is a contention issues between multiple similarly  named libraries or the wrong one is present. Make sure you have installed (from the library manager) the latest TMRh20 RF24 library installed. DO NOT use the maniac bug version. The TMRh20 RF24 Library has printf in it as well.

PENTEST_NRF is a newly developed library for easy reliable rf communication using the rfmicro and nrf24. Using this library, you still create the RF24 object in your own code and thus retain all of it's members while being given supplemental functions and reliable transmission abstraction aimed towards penetration testing. 
## Various Device Pinouts

rfMicro - CE:8 CSN:7
rfNano  - CE:10 CSN:9
nrfShields - CE:9 CSN:10

## Working Examples

### rfCMDuserInput

Reciever must be an rfMicro. Make sure to check CE and CSN pins. Enter commands from the serial monitor of the host computer and have them sent over RF transmission and typed into the host's command prompt or terminal. Working with windows and mac, bug fix needed in linux.

### Reliability Test

Connect PIN 2 to GROUND on one node (RX). Does not use keyboard functions, use to test reliability of transmission methods. I have sent 200+ transmissions without a single failure. it will print the failure count anytime one occurs AFTER first contact has occurred.

## Malduino Compatibility

The malduino contains and SD card and a button that are not present on the rfMicro. Malduino scripts relying heavily on the sd card require further adjustment however most simply need to have the use of the button (that starts a script) taken out. This can easily be exchanged for a trigger command over the RF channel.
